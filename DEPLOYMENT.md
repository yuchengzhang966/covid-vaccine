# COVID-19 Dashboard Deployment Guide

## 🚀 Deploy to Vercel

### Step 1: Push to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "deleted floating bar"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Deploy via Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Import your GitHub repository
4. Vercel will auto-detect the static site
5. Click "Deploy"

### Step 3: Verify Deployment
- Check that the deployed site shows the modern Apple-like design
- Verify all controls are working (sliders, dropdowns)
- Test data loading and visualizations

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If the site looks different on Vercel:

1. **Check File Structure**: Ensure these files are in the root directory:
   - `index.html` (modern version)
   - `styles.css` (modern Apple-like design)
   - `main.js` (React components)
   - `vercel.json` (deployment config)

2. **Verify Data Loading**: Check browser console for errors:
   - Data files should load from `./src/data/`
   - No CORS errors should appear

3. **Force Redeploy**: 
   - Go to Vercel dashboard
   - Click "Redeploy" on your project

### Expected File Structure:
```
covid-vaccine/
├── index.html          ← Modern version
├── styles.css          ← Apple-like design
├── main.js             ← React components
├── vercel.json         ← Deployment config
└── src/
    └── data/           ← CSV data files
        ├── covid1.csv
        ├── covid2.csv
        └── covid3.csv
```
